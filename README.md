# Meet-Up-iOS
The App is developed based on the official SwiftUI tutorial from Apple

This is a Scrumdinger, an app that manages meetings, by arranging groups 
of views to create the meeting timer screen. 

In the process of working on this project, I encountered many errors in the code. 
I had to look for solutions on my own, because there are a lot of missed moments in this tutorial. 
Sometimes the code did not match the one given in the tutorial, but I continued to adapt my code 
to the tutorial to get a similar result.
